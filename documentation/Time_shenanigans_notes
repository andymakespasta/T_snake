Types of time shenanigans:

rewind: 
  time flows backwards. Actions are undone.

past_warp (traveling backwards in time): 
  Character jumps back in time.
  From outside perspective, character disappears, then reappears in the past.
  From player/character perspective, they enter the warp, everything flows backwards, they exit the warp, their past self is doing whatever.
  Because this is snake, entering the warp will take some time.

reverse_time:
  Player contines moving as normal, but outside time flows backwards.
  This is similiar to past_warp, except 


Paradox trigger:
  blocking past snake
  -> killing past snake
  stealing past snake's pellets
  -> stealing past snake's pellets to point of 




Paradox resolution methods:
  game_over: easy to implement.
  rewind to point of warp: may require longer history.
  recalculate and update present:
    






Implementation:

history:

rewind:
  reset state to previous state in history. Some history is "destroyed" as we rewind past it.

past_warp:
  entering_warp: (only needed because we're playing snake, and character takes up space)
    high speed snake entering hole
  start_past_warp:
    warp_enter = now
    warp_exit = now
    current character
  past_warping:
    warp_exit--
    display history(warp_exit)
    display warping character.
  exit warp:
    create echo object

  create echo objects that are linked to history
