================ webassembly / C =====================
ncurses pdcurses have almost the same definitions, target different architetures.
Both extended from spec, to uncompatible

2 Xcurses + emscripten projects look promising:
emcurses: 
	requires installing emscripten


curses.js

temporal superposition / decoherence.
waveform collapse.


potential time stuff: 
	walk into a point -> jump back X ticks.
		(optional) jump has animation during which inputs blocked.
		(optional) after jump, shows future path of snake that jumped.
		show message "temporal superposition COMPLETE"
		show message "WARNING: temporal superposition unstable."
		your past killing you (ex bumping into body of past) -> you die! no problems.
		your past being killed / altered (cutting across your past / others cutting across your past) -> jump back to present, as if no time travel happened.
			show message "paradox detected. waveform collapse imminent."
			animation, everything scrambled, then reverting to frame before jump.
			show message "temporal superposition COMPLETE" -> scramble -> "FAILED"
		Reaching the present removes the warning message.
		implemntation:
			walk into a point -> set target time, start rewind animation
				rewind animation plays ticks backwards. (redrawing everything)
				Create ghost blocks on path snake passes over.
				next tick is still counting up, as timeline may revert.
				when you kill your past, load state back to before jump, wipe everything that happened.
				If you reach the present, overwrite timeline.

	hold a button (potentially consume energy)


	playback after a room is cleared:
		requires entire timeline saved.





normal tick:
	check inputs
	if only normal movement (direction / speed changes)
		update anything that may move.
		if move, redraw.
		add tick.
	if
