main.c:
	simple startup layer & emscripten shim.
		starts main_loop. This this calls "engine_loop"

engine.c
	handles "real time"
	handles input by sending it to specific managers / objects.
	calls ticks on all the managers. //this is always before object ticks.
	calls ticks on all the objects.
	calls the draw function on current gamestate.

gamestate.h: central location for gamestate object

managers:
	timeline manager: 
		potentially completely wipes the board and replaces with new objects.
		takes snapshots.


objects: (blah_obj.c / blah_obj.h)
  any code that is specific to an object / interaction between objects should be in an object
	need to implement a tick function (updates the object) 
	need to implement a draw function




echo_objects:
  objects that follow behaviour from first time through timeline.
  contains reference to corresponding object in the past.
  Each tick, check past object, and update self location.
  need to implement a draw function (call draw of original function!)




snake object:
  One way to write the snake game would be to have the object just be a head + a list of body parts.
  Each step, the head moves forward, and spawns a body part.
  The body part displayed depends on how far it is from the head.
