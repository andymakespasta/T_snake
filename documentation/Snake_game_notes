Snake movement:
  The snake will always be of fixed length (even if we're moving at double speed)







Random pellet generation:
  Random, but fixed order.
  The nth random pellet will always be at the same spot:
    if you rewind past eating -> generating pellet, then eat the pellet again, the new pellet will be at the same spot.
    if you travel to the past (and steal a pellet from yourself without killing yourself), the new pellet will be at the same spot as the next pellet in the past (potentially creating a domino effect of changes).

  If a pellet is blocked, move to close adjacent space.
